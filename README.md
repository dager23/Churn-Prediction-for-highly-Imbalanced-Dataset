# Churn-Prediction-for-highly-Imbalanced-Dataset
The project uses a ADASYN and Weighted Random Forest to handle class imbalance

In this project we have explored on methods to handle datasets with high class imbalance.
We have considered 4 datasets for our analysis.
Each dataset has minority class in 2%, 1.7%, 16%, 36%.
We have trained each dataset for Random Forest, Sampled With ADASYN and trained on Random Forest, Sampled With ADASYN and trained on Weighted Random Forest.
We can note a significant increase in Testing Accuracy and Confusion Matrix metrics when we train the dataset using ADASYN and Weighted Random Forest.
We have succesfully able to establish that the proposed framework is robust to handle high class imbalance and help train and learn the dataset by the model better,
